            <p>At the heart of this movement is a reimagining of heritage. The barong and the terno, iconic symbols of national identity, are no longer reserved for formal events. Designers are transf[...]</p>
            <p>Interestingly, minimalism and gender-neutral design are also making waves. Clean lines, neutral tones, and unisex silhouettes are becoming increasingly popular – signaling a shift in [...]</p>
            <p>But perhaps the most powerful shift is philosophical: Filipino style today is less about following and more about becoming. As noted by insiders, fashion is now a tool for personal narr[...]</p>

            <p>These direct costs, however, paint only part of the picture. According to a WHO/UNDP “investment case” report, mental health conditions in the Philippines annually cost the economy [...]</p>
            <p>The public system, while theoretically a safeguard, is limited. Government spending on mental health is meager: only about 2.65% of the health budget is earmarked for it, and most of th[...]</p>
            <p>The human cost is profound. A shortage of trained professionals compounds the problem: for every 100,000 Filipinos, there are only about 0.5 psychiatrists and 0.1 psychologists. ￼ Th[...]</p>
